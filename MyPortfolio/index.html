    <h4 >Who am I?</h4>
        <p>My name is Robert Alin Coroama and I am student at KEA - Multimedia Design and Communication.I'm 20 years old, based in Copenhagen, originally from Romania.</p>
    <h4>My GOALS?</h4>
        <p>Probably my biggest target is to be a succesfull video editor, because that's my main passion, and I am trying to improve it as much as possible.Getting a position to a company, it's a huge step in getting closer to my deam. I am also interested in UX field; I've discovered this during the study time, when I've been tasking with UX stuff, which actually are not boring, as anyone thinks. For this, you must have good communication skills and some knowledge in human relationships.</p>

        <p class="p1">My projects represents my work, they define my skills, and some of them are not as I wanted to be, but at that time, I was proud of them.
            <br>"Better than yesterday" - That's the quote which defines me.

            <h4>My first portfolio website</h4>
            <p>Here's my first portfolio website that contains all my school projects from the first semester. Those projects were not that complicated, but I've invested a lot of time, so I think it's worth to be shown!</p>
            <p>You are at your own risk!<a href="http://alincoroama.com/examen/exam%20portfolio/firstpage.html"> CLICK ME</a> !</p>
        
            <h4>Animated LOGO</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create an animated logo for a company, starting from 0. For me, Adobe After Effects is still a challange, but I've chose to face this fear, and here is the result.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/wzPzDn42d5I">CLICK ME</a></a></p>
            <h4>Promoting an ARTIST</h4>
            <p>During this project I had to face a lot of impediments, because working with an artist is harder than you could expect. But actually, this one is one of my favorite projects because it was dynamic, based on human's behaviour. I've been tasked with UX and both Video recording and edit, interviews, which require good social skills</p>
            <p>The artist website is <a href="http://alincoroama.com/KrisIvy/">here</a>!</p>
